# Extract-and-Load

This code will guide you on how to download files from a destination server to a local or remote server using SFTP.

I originally prepared this code during my work at Vodafone Idea (VI).
For security reasons, I have hidden details such as server addresses, destination paths, and remote paths. You can replace these with your own details and use the scripts directly.
