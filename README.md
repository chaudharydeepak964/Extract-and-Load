# Extract-and-Load

This Code will guide you how you can downlaod the file from Destination server to local/Remote server.

I prepare this code in my current orginaisation VI.

I hide the some details like-Server details, Destination and Remote path just for some security purpose. You can change it with yours and use directly.

In this Repo You will find 4 files in which 2 different Methods of Extract and Load

# SFTP_File-Extract.py and Report_Upload-Load.py >> simple SFTP Method 1 by 1 downlaod and upload 1 by 1

# SFTP_Method2-Extract.py and Upload_Method2-Load.py >> Advanced SFTP Method downlaod and upload at once.
